## Iron_Shard suggestions
New Feature Suggestion: Have a Shuffle Default Background, So you can store several background pictures in the default and you can have it switch every song to a new one, so you don't see the same thing over and over.

New Small Feature Suggestion: Make your own Preset Audio Volumes, so you can instantly switch to a background type thing, or more of a go all out, or just enjoy instead of tweaking a lot to get it right.

New Feature Suggestion: Be able to sort by Date Added, Or Date Added to Playlist.

New Feature Suggestion: Be able to do drag and drop sorting in a playlist, for example by activation of a button click so you don't do it accidentally.

New Feature Suggestion: Be able to have preset visualizer colors to assign to current song, or to an entire playlist, or assign an entire background to a playlist.

I Didn't Like: 
- That adding to playlists are kinda of a long process
- That there were too many options within options
- Personally i never got the download with video to work on my own machine, don't know why, but i didn't like it (though i know you ain't to blame)
- The whole grouping mechanic, it's just too much of a hassle, considering if you have a lot of songs and you want to organize
