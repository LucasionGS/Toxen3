# Toxen3 Development

## TODO
### Base Requirements
- Side panel
  - Toggleable from button presses.
  - Menu can switch between different panels.
    - Panels: `Songs`, `Settings`, `Playlist Management`, `Edit song data`

### Improvements from v2
- Asynchronize loading of Songs, and overall use an async structure.
- Playlists: Simplier creation, renaming, deleting, and general managing.
  - For god sake, store them separately. Not in the fucking song details individually.
- Visualizer: Smooth out visuals
- Storyboard: Drop the custom language concept entirely, make an editor immmediately using JSON storage
